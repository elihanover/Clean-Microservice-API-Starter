# CLEAN Microservice API Starter

### Adaptors // Extensibility
I build this for my own use as a starter repository with prebuilt adaptors to 3rd party services (Firebase, AWS, etc.).

Similar adaptors (auth, nosql, sql) map to a shared interface which you can find in their respective Markdown files.  This allow you to migrate services without touching core logic.  To add new ones, just write a new adaptor to the relevant interface.

### Next:
- I will be adding more adaptors for my own use, please feel free to PR any that you've built.
- More documentation to come.
